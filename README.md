# How I Write Papers

By Autumn Scott

When writing papers I usually start by identifying my purpose for writing, followed by three points to back up my purpose. Then, I create a handwritten rough draft that I can refer back to while working on my final document. Finally, I type up my final document while referring back to my rouch draft so that I can make revisions as I see fit. I always read through my doucment several times so that I make sure it flows nicely. After I'm happy with what I've written, I turn it in.
